# PBK Parameter Grouping
This repository contains the code used for producing the results publiced in Tsiros et al. (2024). In the publication, a novel parameter grouping approach using genetic algorithms for Physiologically-based Kinetic (PBK) models is presented. The approach is demonstrated through two case studies: one focusing on PBK model development for TiO2 nanoparticle biodistribution and a second one displaying how parameter grouping can be utilised for extending an existing PBK model for PFOA. The code and data of each case study can be found in the respective folders.
